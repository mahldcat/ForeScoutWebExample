# ForeScoutWebExample

This is a quick and dirty set of projects that I threw together in about 2 hours to demonstrate 
how I might approach consuming a web service, and breaking it apart so the logic would work in a command line app or a website in .Net Core.

While this is using a Microsoft Tech Stack, the actual implementation was created and runs on Ubuntu Linux (mind blowing yes?)

to run, make sure the machine you are pulling this code from has .net Core 3.1 installed on it, and  from the folder where you cloned this project, issue the command 

`dotnet build`
`dotnet run --project ./ForeScoutWeb/ForeScoutWeb.csproj`
